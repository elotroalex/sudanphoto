The Sudan Historical Photography Archive gathers, preserves, and makes available historical photographs of Sudan for researchers and students.

Begun in late 2016 by Khartoum University’s History Department, the Sudan Historical Photography Archive is part of a broader effort by the History Department to assemble a photographic library of Sudan’s history as an educational resource for students in Sudan. The archive collects original photography that documents Sudan’s history, preserves them, and stores them digitally so they are accessible to researchers and students studying Sudan.

These photographs reveal different aspects of Sudanese society--not only important moments, but also critical information on the architecture, society, and social relationships present in Sudan in the past. It is our hope that they will be used by all those seeking to understand Sudanese society and its historical evolution.
